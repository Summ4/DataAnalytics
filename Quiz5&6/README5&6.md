# Data Analytics Mini Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying regression and classification models on earthquake data to analyze and predict certain parameters. The project uses Python for data analysis and scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Files

- `earthquakes_global.csv`: The main dataset containing earthquake data.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and machine learning models.

## Tasks and Models

### 1. Simple Linear Regression

Implemented a single variable regression model and calculated model efficiency.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression

Implemented a multivariable regression model and calculated model efficiency.

### 3. Decision Tree Regression

Used a decision tree regression model on one or more variables and calculated the model's performance.

### 4. Logistic Regression

Applied a logistic regression model, calculated its efficiency, and tested the results on new data.

### 5. Decision Tree Classification

Applied a decision tree classification model to one or more variables and calculated the model's performance.
